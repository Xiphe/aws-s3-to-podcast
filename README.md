# tagesform_transcribe_meta

This project automatically extracts meta information from mp3 files
uploaded to an s3 bucket and creates transcriptions

I use this for my Podcast ["Tagesform"](https://hannesdiem.de/tag/tagesform/)

Feel free to copy any of the code for your own projects.
I probably won't maintain this though :)
